# BooksWorld - Android App
This app was originally created because there are too many websites and sources to search through to find specific books, and even when you find them, it can be exhausting to keep track of the current page. That's why I created this Android app, to make it easier to search and read books over the internet, for free.

BooksWorld is designed to let you conveniently search and download books from various websites. This app contains more than 60k books.

You can also read books and change the font and size, bookmark your favourite books and track your current page.
## Features

The android app lets you:
- Support Books from multiple website
- Synchronziation with other devices.
- Increase and decrease the size of the font and also switch between a serif or sans-serif font for a more comfortable reading experience.
- Switch between numerous themes.
- Possibility to cache images locallya for offline reading.
